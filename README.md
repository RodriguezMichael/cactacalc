# cactacalc

I've made this little windows app that helps you decide on which row/column to choose in Mini Cactpot. 
I'm not a programmer, so the app is really crude (and ugly!), but it works :)
Code is a mess too and far from being optimal.

#HOW TO:
"0" = unscratched value.
Change any 0 (zeros) to values that show up on Cactpot and hit "Calculate". 
In blue fields it will show all the expected (probability term) values for all rows/columns.
You may get less or more, but in the long run the expected value is what you would get if you'd pick that option hundreds of times.

TLDR:
Input cactpot values in place of zeros. Check the blue fields and pick the row/column with a highest number.
